the function *total_summary*. This will allow you to quickly and easily
visualize all the summary stats you might like to know about a given
variable in a dataframe. You can choose to group this summary variable
by one or more grouping variables, if you would like, or leave out the
grouping entirely.

To be specific, the summary statistics output by *total_summary* are the
mean, range, minimum, 1st quartile, median, 3rd quartile, and maximum.
